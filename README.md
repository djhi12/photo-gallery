# Overview

In this project, I've developed a Photo Gallery using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The purpose behind this project is to further my learning as a software engineer and demonstrate my understanding of JavaScript language syntax by implementing a practical application.

The software allows users to view a collection of photos in a visually appealing gallery format. Users can navigate through the gallery, view individual photos in a larger size, and potentially interact with them depending on the features implemented.

You can watch a 4-5 minute demonstration of the software running and a walkthrough of the code in this Software Demo Video.

# Development Environment

For this project, I utilized the following tools:

- Text Editor: I used Visual Studio Code as my primary text editor for writing and editing code.
- Browser: Chrome Developer Tools were instrumental in debugging and testing the functionality of the application.

The programming languages and libraries used in this project include:

- HTML: For structuring the content of the web page.
- CSS: For styling the elements and designing the layout of the gallery.
- JavaScript: For implementing the interactive features and functionality of the gallery.
- Any additional libraries were not used in this project to maintain a focus on vanilla JavaScript.

# Useful Websites

During the development of this project, I found the following websites helpful:

- MDN Web Docs: A comprehensive resource for web development documentation and tutorials.
- Stack Overflow: A community-driven platform for asking and answering programming-related questions.

# Future Work

For future iterations of this Photo Gallery project, I plan to:

- Implement responsive design to ensure the gallery displays optimally across various devices and screen sizes.
- Add functionality for users to upload their own photos and customize their galleries.
- Improve accessibility features to ensure the gallery is usable for all users, including those with disabilities.
- Enhance performance by optimizing code and loading images asynchronously.
- Implement additional features such as search and filter options for organizing the photo collection.
- Refactor code for better maintainability and readability, adhering to best practices and design patterns.
